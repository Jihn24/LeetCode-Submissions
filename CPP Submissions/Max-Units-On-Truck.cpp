// 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck
// You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array boxTypes, where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
//     numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
//     numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
// You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. 
// You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
// Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
